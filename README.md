# badaso/starter

If you working on fresh project, you may create a new Laravel + Badaso project by using Composer directly. After the application has been created, you may start Badaso's local development server using the Artisan CLI's serve command:

## Installation

```
composer create-project badaso/starter badaso_project

cd badaso_project

# via local machine
php artisan serve

# via docker
docker compose build
docker composer up -d
```
